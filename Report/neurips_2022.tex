\title{Formatting Instructions For NeurIPS 2022}


% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to break the
% lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So, if LaTeX puts 3 of 4
% authors names on the first line, and the last on the second line, try using
% \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\section{Data analysis task}
\label{headings}

It is important to evaluate the different types of data in order to do the correct data analysis. The dataset presents three different types of data: numerical variables, categorical variables and, binary ad ordinal variables. Each of the types mentioned should be treated differently.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Which are the numerical features and which are the categorical features? 

The dataset was separated between numerical features, categorical features, and also binary and ordinal features.
The numerical features are the features which have an inherent ordering. It can be separated in continuous variables and discrete variables. The numeral features can be seen bellow:

\begin{equation}
temp, dew, humidity, precip, snow, snowdepth, windspeed,
cloudcover, visibility
\label{eq:1}
\end{equation}

The continuous variables are ideal for histograms because they can take on an infinite number of values within a range. The discrete variables are often more appropriate for bar charts. The graphs that shows the relation between probability density and each one of the numerical features can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:1}, \ref{fig:2} and \ref{fig:3}.

\begin{figure}[htb!]
\caption{Numerical features - temp, dew, humidity.}
\label{fig:1}
    
\subfloat[\label{P1}temperature]{
        \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{Code/Plots/probability_density_temp.png}
    }\hfill
     \subfloat[\label{P2}dew]{
        \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{Code/Plots/probability_density_dew.png}
    } \hfill
        \subfloat[\label{P3}humidity]{
        \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{Code/Plots/probability_density_humidity.png}
     }
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htb!]
\caption{Numerical features - precip, windspeed, snowdepth.}
\label{fig:2}
    
\subfloat[\label{P4}precipitation]{
        \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{Code/Plots/probability_density_precip.png}
    }\hfill
     \subfloat[\label{P5}windspeed]{
        \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{Code/Plots/probability_density_windspeed.png}
    } \hfill
        \subfloat[\label{P6}snowdepth]{
        \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{Code/Plots/probability_density_snowdepth.png}
     }
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htb!]
\caption{Numerical features - cloudcover, visibility.}
\label{fig:3}
    
\subfloat[\label{P7}cloudcover]{
        \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{Code/Plots/probability_density_cloudcover.png}
    } \hfill
        \subfloat[\label{P8}visibility]{
        \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{Code/Plots/probability_density_visibility.png}
     }
\end{figure}
   


In the categorical features there is no inherent ordering.  For this case, it can be seen bellow:

\begin{equation}
increase \textunderscore stock
\label{eq:2}
\end{equation}

Histograms are not typically used for categorical variables since these variables represent categories that do not have an intrinsic order. Bar charts are more suitable for representing categorical data.

The binary and ordinal features can be seen bellow:

\begin{equation}
hour \textunderscore of \textunderscore day, day \textunderscore of \textunderscore week, month, holiday, weekday, summertime
\label{eq:3}
\end{equation}

The binary features are only two categories, for example, Yes/No or True/False. Histograms are not usually used for binary variables because there are only two bars to display, which does not convey much information about distribution. Instead, a bar chart or pie chart might be used.

The ordinal features have a set order, for example, poor to excelent, but the intervals between the categories are not necessarily equal. Histograms can be used with ordinal data; however, the ordered nature of the data must be preserved in the bins of the histogram, and often a bar chart is clearer.

\item Is there a greater trend to need an increase in the availability of bicycles?
Plotting the weekdays against the increase stock feature shows an increase in demand for bicycles during the rush-hour windows six to nine in the morning and three to seven in the afternoon. This is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:}
    \end{enumerate}

\subsection{Headings: second level}


Second-level headings should be in 10-point type.


\subsubsection{Headings: third level}


Third-level headings should be in 10-point type.


\paragraph{Paragraphs}


There is also a \verb+\paragraph+ command available, which sets the heading in
bold, flush left, and inline with the text, with the heading followed by 1\,em
of space.


\section{Citations, figures, tables, references}
\label{others}


These instructions apply to everyone.


\subsection{Citations within the text}


The \verb+natbib+ package will be loaded for you by default.  Citations may be
author/year or numeric, as long as you maintain internal consistency.  As to the
format of the references themselves, any style is acceptable as long as it is
used consistently.


The documentation for \verb+natbib+ may be found at
\begin{center}
  \url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/natbib/natnotes.pdf}
\end{center}
Of note is the command \verb+\citet+, which produces citations appropriate for
use in inline text.  For example,
\begin{verbatim}
   \citet{hasselmo} investigated\dots
\end{verbatim}
produces
\begin{quote}
  Hasselmo, et al.\ (1995) investigated\dots
\end{quote}


If you wish to load the \verb+natbib+ package with options, you may add the
following before loading the \verb+neurips_2022+ package:
\begin{verbatim}
   \PassOptionsToPackage{options}{natbib}
\end{verbatim}


If \verb+natbib+ clashes with another package you load, you can add the optional
argument \verb+nonatbib+ when loading the style file:
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[nonatbib]{neurips_2022}
\end{verbatim}


As submission is double blind, refer to your own published work in the third
person. That is, use ``In the previous work of Jones et al.\ [4],'' not ``In our
previous work [4].'' If you cite your other papers that are not widely available
(e.g., a journal paper under review), use anonymous author names in the
citation, e.g., an author of the form ``A.\ Anonymous.''


\subsection{Footnotes}


Footnotes should be used sparingly.  If you do require a footnote, indicate
footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of the first footnote.} in the
text. Place the footnotes at the bottom of the page on which they appear.
Precede the footnote with a horizontal rule of 2~inches (12~picas).


Note that footnotes are properly typeset \emph{after} punctuation
marks.\footnote{As in this example.}


\subsection{Figures}


\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \fbox{\rule[-.5cm]{0cm}{4cm} \rule[-.5cm]{4cm}{0cm}}
  \caption{Sample figure caption.}
\end{figure}


All artwork must be neat, clean, and legible. Lines should be dark enough for
purposes of reproduction. The figure number and caption always appear after the
figure. Place one line space before the figure caption and one line space after
the figure. The figure caption should be lower case (except for first word and
proper nouns); figures are numbered consecutively.


You may use color figures.  However, it is best for the figure captions and the
paper body to be legible if the paper is printed in either black/white or in
color.


\subsection{Tables}


All tables must be centered, neat, clean and legible.  The table number and
title always appear before the table.  See Table~\ref{sample-table}.


Place one line space before the table title, one line space after the
table title, and one line space after the table. The table title must
be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns); tables are
numbered consecutively.


Note that publication-quality tables \emph{do not contain vertical rules.} We
strongly suggest the use of the \verb+booktabs+ package, which allows for
typesetting high-quality, professional tables:
\begin{center}
  \url{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/booktabs}
\end{center}
This package was used to typeset Table~\ref{sample-table}.


\begin{table}
  \caption{Sample table title}
  \label{sample-table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{lll}
    \toprule
    \multicolumn{2}{c}{Part}                   \\
    \cmidrule(r){1-2}
    Name     & Description     & Size ($\mu$m) \\
    \midrule
    Dendrite & Input terminal  & $\sim$100     \\
    Axon     & Output terminal & $\sim$10      \\
    Soma     & Cell body       & up to $10^6$  \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}


\section{Final instructions}


Do not change any aspects of the formatting parameters in the style files.  In
particular, do not modify the width or length of the rectangle the text should
fit into, and do not change font sizes (except perhaps in the
\textbf{References} section; see below). Please note that pages should be
numbered.


\section{Preparing PDF files}


Please prepare submission files with paper size ``US Letter,'' and not, for
example, ``A4.''


Fonts were the main cause of problems in the past years. Your PDF file must only
contain Type 1 or Embedded TrueType fonts. Here are a few instructions to
achieve this.


\begin{itemize}


\item You should directly generate PDF files using \verb+pdflatex+.


\item You can check which fonts a PDF files uses.  In Acrobat Reader, select the
  menu Files$>$Document Properties$>$Fonts and select Show All Fonts. You can
  also use the program \verb+pdffonts+ which comes with \verb+xpdf+ and is
  available out-of-the-box on most Linux machines.


\item The IEEE has recommendations for generating PDF files whose fonts are also
  acceptable for NeurIPS. Please see
  \url{http://www.emfield.org/icuwb2010/downloads/IEEE-PDF-SpecV32.pdf}


\item \verb+xfig+ "patterned" shapes are implemented with bitmap fonts.  Use
  "solid" shapes instead.


\item The \verb+\bbold+ package almost always uses bitmap fonts.  You should use
  the equivalent AMS Fonts:
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage{amsfonts}
\end{verbatim}
followed by, e.g., \verb+\mathbb{R}+, \verb+\mathbb{N}+, or \verb+\mathbb{C}+
for $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{N}$ or $\mathbb{C}$.  You can also use the following
workaround for reals, natural and complex:
\begin{verbatim}
   \newcommand{\RR}{I\!\!R} %real numbers
   \newcommand{\Nat}{I\!\!N} %natural numbers
   \newcommand{\CC}{I\!\!\!\!C} %complex numbers
\end{verbatim}
Note that \verb+amsfonts+ is automatically loaded by the \verb+amssymb+ package.


\end{itemize}


If your file contains type 3 fonts or non embedded TrueType fonts, we will ask
you to fix it.


\subsection{Margins in \LaTeX{}}


Most of the margin problems come from figures positioned by hand using
\verb+\special+ or other commands. We suggest using the command
\verb+\includegraphics+ from the \verb+graphicx+ package. Always specify the
figure width as a multiple of the line width as in the example below:
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx} ...
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{myfile.pdf}
\end{verbatim}
See Section 4.4 in the graphics bundle documentation
(\url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/required/graphics/grfguide.pdf})


A number of width problems arise when \LaTeX{} cannot properly hyphenate a
line. Please give LaTeX hyphenation hints using the \verb+\-+ command when
necessary.


\begin{ack}
Use unnumbered first level headings for the acknowledgments. All acknowledgments
go at the end of the paper before the list of references. Moreover, you are required to declare
funding (financial activities supporting the submitted work) and competing interests (related financial activities outside the submitted work).
More information about this disclosure can be found at: \url{https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2022/PaperInformation/FundingDisclosure}.


Do {\bf not} include this section in the anonymized submission, only in the final paper. You can use the \texttt{ack} environment provided in the style file to autmoatically hide this section in the anonymized submission.
\end{ack}


\section*{References}


References follow the acknowledgments. Use unnumbered first-level heading for
the references. Any choice of citation style is acceptable as long as you are
consistent. It is permissible to reduce the font size to \verb+small+ (9 point)
when listing the references.
Note that the Reference section does not count towards the page limit.
